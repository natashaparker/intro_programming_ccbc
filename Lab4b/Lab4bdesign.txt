Lab4b Design

Specification
	Design and implement an application that reads a string from the 
	user and then determines and prints how many of each lowercase 
	vowel (a, e, i, o, and u) appear in the entire string. Have a separate 
	counter for each vowel. Also count and print the number of non vowel 
	characters.

Input
	String my_string

Processes
	DO
		Get user inputed string from standard input
		store user input in my_string
	WHILE
		my_string is not equal to 0

	FOR counter is less than the length of my_string
		Iterate through string
		compare each character to vowel
		IF character equals 'a'
			increment cnt_a
		IF character equals 'e'
			increment cnt_e
		IF character equals 'i'
			Increment cnt_i
		IF character equals 'o'
			increment cnt_o
		IF character equals 'u'
			increment cnt_u
		ELSE
			Verify character is not space
			increment cnt_non_vowel
Output
	Display Count for each variable to standard output
	Display count for non-vowel characters
